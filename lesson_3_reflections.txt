1.Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

We might not yet want to upload the code or changes made(commits) for the public view.... Also, while working, we might want to keep the original running on....

2.Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

Forks are the copy of somene's repositoryon the Github server itself....
Clones are the copy of a repository from Github server to in one's local machine...
Branches are the different series of commits created locally in a repository ....

Uses are pretty significant from the functions they describe....

3.What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?

So that we can even make offline changes to it... 

4.How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub? What would be easier, and what would be harder?

I will have to collaborate using emails, attachements, drive etc.... It would be easier to share these but a lot more difficult to merge again and collaboratively work together...
Also the so many useful features of git and github will be lost...

5.When would you want to make changes in a separate branch rather than directly in master? What benefits does each approach have?

Whenever we want to work on a new feature or create another version of something or need to experiment and get it checked, we generally use a different branch as we don't want to break our master branch...
Well working on different branches might be a little tiresome and confusing at first, but by the passage of time and adaptibility, it would be easier... 
By working on different branches, we are free to manipulate our code ang get it checked before adding it to the main master branch...
