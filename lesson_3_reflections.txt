1.Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

We might not yet want to upload the code or changes made(commits) for the public view.... Also, while working, we might want to keep the original running on....

2.Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

Forks are the copy of somene's repositoryon the Github server itself....
Clones are the copy of a repository from Github server to in one's local machine...
Branches are the different series of commits created locally in a repository ....

Uses are pretty significant from the functions they describe....
